# Power BI Dashboard Creation: An E-Commerce Analysis
- This repository showcases the process of creating an insightful Power BI dashboard for an e-commerce business. The steps and visualizations were inspired by a guided instructional course. Here's a breakdown of what was achieved:

# 1. Chart Selection and Creation
## Challenge: With a plethora of chart options in Power BI, selecting the right one can be daunting.
### Solution:
- Time Series Chart: A line chart was created to visualize sales data over time.
- Data Linkage: Order Date was set to the X-axis and Order Total to the Y-axis.
- Adjustments: Default date hierarchy was replaced with the actual order date for clarity.
- Waterfall Chart: This chart was used to visualize aggregate sales data.
- Data Linkage: Prod Category was set as the category and Quantity as the Y-axis, showcasing product sales volumes from highest to lowest.
# 2. Data Slicing for Enhanced Insights
## Challenge: Stakeholders often need to view data subsets based on specific criteria, like categories or states.
### Solution:
- Slicer Creation: A slicer was added to the dashboard to filter data based on the CustState (Customer State) field.
- Adjustments: The slicer was transformed from a list to a dropdown for a compact and user-friendly experience.
- Functionality: Selecting specific states (e.g., California) instantly filters the entire dashboard to reflect data for the chosen state(s).
# 3. Dashboard Aesthetics and Usability
- Adjustments Made:
- Resized and repositioned charts to optimize space and improve readability.
- Adjusted the header size to accommodate the slicer.
- Recommended color format updates for consistency across the dashboard
